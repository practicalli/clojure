# Clojure data types

* Numbers

1 2 3 4 5 6.0


* Ratios


* Strings

* Symbols

The names we give funcitons and data structures to have an easy way to refer to them


* Keywords

Used for [enumerations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration) and as keys in maps (a map is a series of zero or more key value pairs)


* Lists

A linked list, however the first element of a list is evaluated as a function call (unless a quote character is placed in front of the list)


* Maps

essentially hash maps

* Vectors

esentially an array, however its persistent and therefore immutable

* Sets

a unique set of elements, which can be ordered but are not by default
