# Clojure from the Author

A series of important videos from Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure who spent over 2 years designing the fundamental design of Clojure around the concept of simplicity.  Since then Rich has stuarded the continued design and development of Clojure, ensuring it stays true to is founding principles.

You do not need to watch these videos to start coding in Clojure, but they are very useful to adopt the approach and design idioms that make Clojure a highly effective language for software development.


## Expert to Expert: Rich Hickey and Brian Beckman - Inside Clojure
Discussing some of the key characteristics of the Clojure language and why those decisions were taken

## Clojure made simple
Covers the major problems with software development and the challenges most programming languages fail to tackle completely.

Discusses a simple approach to software development and the big picture view of how Clojure solves these problems

## Simplicity Matters
A quote from the video:

_"As we move forward we have to take what we already have and make that [software] do more, make it do things differently, make it do things better,  and as we try to take on manipulating software we are going to be challenged to understand it in order to make that happen.
  And I'll contend that you will completely be dominated by complexity.  I don't care what processes you are using, I don't care how well you test or anything else.  Complexity will dominate what you do."_

## The value of values
Rich Hickey provides analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosophical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data
