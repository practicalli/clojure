![Clojure coding challenges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/code-challenges/clojure-code-challenges.png)

Coding challenges are an excellent way to start learning a new language.  The challenges allow you to focus on the language and not be concerned about the more general engineering aspects of software development.

Challenges are there to explore a language and practice your understanding of how to assemble working code.  It is recommended to try different approaches to solving a challenges and even repeat the same challenges at a later date and see what additional approaches you have learned.

[4Ever-Clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/){target=_blank} is a highly recommended starting point for learning Clojure and does not require any installation or setup.  4Ever-Clojure is a new implementation of 4Clojure.com.
