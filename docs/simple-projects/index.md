# Small Projects

![Projects](/images/projects.png)

An effective way to get comfortable with Clojure is to start writing small projects.  In this section several small projects are used to walk the audience through how to create and develop a project, as well as learn some Clojure functions and functional programming techniques along the way.


| Project                                               | Topics                | Description                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Random Clojure Function](random-clojure-function.md) | namespace vars        | print a random function from the Clojure standard library      |
| [Encoding and decoding](encode-decode/)               | hash-map dictionaries | transforming messages between one form and another             |
| [Data Transformation](data-transformation/)           |                       | transforming larger and larger data sets                       |
| [Test Driven Development and Kata](tdd-kata/)         | Unit testing          | Unit testing and solving challenges using different approaches |


!!! HINT "Create a Clojure project"
    [Clojure CLI tools and clj-new](/clojure/clojure-cli/projects/create-from-template/) to create a new Clojure project.

<!-- | Salary Calculator      | hash-map       | Calculate salaries for permanent and contract roles | -->
<!-- | Java Interoperability  | java lang, interop, java fx  | Using Java libraries to do more   | -->


<!-- Families of functions, e.g. reducing functions, filters, groupings, ??? -->
