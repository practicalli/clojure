# Who uses Clojure

[Hundreds of companies](http://clojure.org/community/companies) actively advertised their Clojure adoption. Given the broad participation in user groups there are clearly many more organizations using Clojure at some level in their technology stack.

A quick scan of various job sites shows Clojure positions at companies like Walmart, Facebook, Staples, Consumer Reports, Salesforce, and Amazon. It doesn't get much more mainstream than that.

If you are looking for a new role using Clojure or other functional programming languages, visit [Functional Works](http://functionalworks.com), the only Functional Recruiters in the world.

Here is just a small and diverse set of example companies that I am aware of that use Clojure for development.

## Tech Radar

Clojure is also defined as a technology that can be adopted since 2014, according to the Thoughtworks technology radar.

JUXT also created its own [Clojure specific technology radar](https://juxt.pro/radar.html) as there is such an encompassing ecosystem of libraries and services.
