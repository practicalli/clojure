### Submit and issue or idea

If something doesn't seem quite right or something is missing from the book, please [raise an issue via the GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure/issues) explaining in as much detail as you can.

### Considering a Pull request?
Before investing any time in a pull request, please raise an issue explaining the situation.  This can save you and the maintainer time and avoid rejected pull requests.

Please keep pull requests small and focused, as they are much quicker to review and easier to accept.  Ideally PR's should be for a specific page or at most a section.

A PR with a list of changes across different sections will not be merged, it will be reviewed eventually though.

## Thank you to everyone that has contributed
A huge thank you to Rich Hickey and the team at Cognitect for creating and continually guiding the Clojure language.  Special thank you to Alex Miller who has provided excellent advice on working with Clojure and the CLI tooling.

The Clojure community has been highly supportive of everyone using Clojure and I'd like to especially thank [Sean Corfield](https://github.com/seancorfield) for all the feedback and contributions made to the community.  I would also like to thank everyone that has joined in with the [London Clojurians community](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/), [ClojureBridgeLondon](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/), [Clojurians Slack community](http://clojurians.net/), [Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/) community and [Clojureverse community](https://clojureverse.org/).

Thank you to everyone who sponsors the Practicalli websites and videos and for the recent [Clojurists Together sponsorship](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/), it helps me continue the work at a much faster pace.

Special thanks to [Bruce Durling](https://twitter.com/otfrom) for getting me into Cloure in the first place.
