# Defining behaviours with functions

Clojure has functions, rather than methods for defining behaviour / "algorithms"

Clojure design at its most basic comprises:
 - one or more data structures
 - functions that process those datastructures

There is a common saying in Clojure: "Its better to have one data structure and many functions, than many data structures and many functions"
