# Editor User Guides - The Basics

We would like you to spend as much of your time at the workshop learning Clojure, so here are some guides that just cover the essential usage of our recommended editors.

## Using Vim

We don't directly support Vim, although you can use it with the fireplace plugin.

Both Spacemacs and Atom/Proton have great support for Vim style editing and so are a viable alternative.
