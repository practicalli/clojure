# REPL Driven Development
REPL driven development is the foundation of working with Clojure effectively.

The REPL is an instant feedback workflow that continually runs your code without the need to manually run an explicit compile-build-run cycle.

The REPL contains the live application to which you interact with by calling (evaluating) code.  A single expression can be called to focus in on its behavior and see the results.  Even when evaluating a whole namespace, each expression is evaluated by itself in turn, within the REPL process.

> #### Hint::Always run a REPL
> Coding with a REPL provides fast feedback as design decisions are encoded.  The REPL feedback tests the assumptions driving the design choices.  Important design choices should be codified in unit tests, optionally using spec.


<!-- * Read - code is read by the Clojure reader, passing any macros to the macro reader which converts those macros into Clojure code. -->

<!-- * Evaluate - code is compiled into the host language (e.g. Java bytecode) and executed -->

<!-- * Print - results of the code are displayed, either in the REPL or as part of the application. -->

<!-- * Loop - the REPL is a continuous process that evaluates code, either a single expression or the whole application. -->


## Evaluating source code
A Clojure aware editor should be used to evaluate code in the REPL from source code files, displaying the results inline.

## Rich Comment blocks - living documentation
The `(comment ,,,)` function is used to included code that is only run by the developer directly.  Unlike `;;` comments, expressions inside a comment block can be evaluated using a [Clojure aware editor](/clojure-editors/).

Expressions in rich comment blocks can represent how to use the functions that make up the namespace API.  For example, starting/restarting the system, updating the database, etc.  Expressions provide examples of calling functions with typical arguments and make a project more accessible and easier to work with.

![Practicalli Clojure Repl Driven Development - Rich comment blocks example](/images/practicalli-clojure-repl-driven-development-rich-comment-blocks.png)

Rich comment blocks are very useful for rapidly iterating over different design decisions by including the same function but with different implementations.  Hide [clj-kondo linter](/clojure-cli/install/install-clojure.html#clj-kondo-static-analyser--linter) warnings for redefined vars (`def`, `defn`) when using this approach.

```clojure
;; Rich comment block with redefined vars ignored
#_{:clj-kondo/ignore [:redefined-var]}
(comment
  (defn value-added-tax []
    ;; algorithm design - first try)

  (defn value-added-tax []
    ;; algorithm design - first try)

  ) ;; End of rich comment block
```

The "Rich" in the name also refers to Rich Hickey, the author and benevolent dictator of Clojure design.


## Design Journal
Creating a journal of the decisions made as code is designed makes the project easier to understand and maintain.  Journals avoid the need for long hand-over or painful developer on-boarding processes as the journey through design decisions are already documented.

A design journal can be added as a `(comment ,,,)` section at the bottom of each namespace, or more typically in its own namespace.

A journal should cover the following aspects

* Relevant expressions use to test assumptions about design options.
* Examples of design choices not taken and discussions why (saves repeating the same design discussions)
* Expressions that can be evaluated to explain how a function or parts of a function work

The design journal can be used to create meaningful documentation for the project very easily and should prevent time spent on repeating the same conversations.

## Viewing data structures
Pretty Print show results of function calls in a human-friendly form. When results are data structures, pretty print makes it easier for a developer to parse and more likely to notice incorrect results.

[Clojure Data Browsers](/clojure-cli/data-browsers/reveal.md) ([cider-inspect](/clojure-cli/data-browsers/clojure-inspector.md), [Reveal](/clojure-cli/data-browsers/reveal.md), [Portal](/clojure-cli/data-browsers/portal.md)) provide effective ways to navigate through a nested data structures and large data sets.

## Code Style and idiomatic Clojure
Clojure aware editors should automatically apply formatting that follows the [Clojure Style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide).  For example, line comments as `;;`, 2 space indents and aligning forms.

Live linting with [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo) highlights a wide range of syntax errors as code is written, minimizing bugs and therefore speeding up the development process.

## Test Driven Development and REPL Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) and REPL Driven Development (RDD) complement each other as they both encourage incremental changes and continuous feedback.

RDD supports rapid design with different approaches easily explored and evaluated. Unit tests focus the results of those experiments to guide delivery of the correct outcomes. Tests also provide critical feedback when changes break that design.

![Clojure REPL driven development (RDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/repl-tdd-flow.png)

[Unit tests](/testing/unit-testing/) should support the public API of each namespace in a project to help prevent regressions in the code.  Its far more efficient in terms of thinking time to define unit tests as the design starts to stabilize than as an after thought.

`clojure.test` library is part of the Clojure standard library that provides a simple way to start writing unit tests.

[Clojure spec](/clojure-spec/) can also be used for generative testing, providing far greater scope in values used when running unit tests.  Specifications can be defined for values and functions.

Clojure has a number of [test runners](/testing/test-runners/) available.  Kaocha is a test runner that will run unit tests and function specification checks.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
Add a [continuous integration service](/testing/integration-testing/) to run tests and builds code on every shared commit (or every commit if you run a CI server locally).

[CircleCI](/testing/integration-testing/circle-ci/) provides a simple to use service that supports Clojure projects.  [Heroku CI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci), [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) also provide CI services.

[Deployment via continuous integration](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services/projects/banking-on-clojure/deployment-via-ci.html) ensures all tests pass before deployment.

[Defining a deployment pipeline](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services/projects/banking-on-clojure/deployment-pipeline.html) provides an efficient way to deploy applications and also get fast feedback from a wider range of stakeholders and users, especially when spin up testable deployments of your application based on commits  (i.e. push to shared develop or feature branch).

## Live Coding with Data - Stuart Halloway
There are few novel features of programming languages, but each combination has different properties. The combination of dynamic, hosted, functional, extended Lisp in Clojure gives developers the tools for making effective programs. Less well understood are the ways in which Clojure's unique combination of features can yield a highly effective development process.

Over more than a decade, we have developed an effective approach to writing code in Clojure whose power comes from composing many of its key features. As different as Clojure programs are from e.g. Java programs, so to can and should be the development experience. You are not in Kansas anymore!

This talk presents a demonstration of the leverage you can get when writing programs in Clojure, with examples, based on my experiences as a core developer of Clojure and Datomic.
