## Create deps.edn project
Use Clojure CLI and `clj-new`

```shell
clojure -M:new app practicalli/banking-on-clojure
```

> #### Hint::practicalli/banking-on-clojure repository
> [practicalli/banking-on-clojure repository](https://github.com/practicalli/banking-on-clojure-spec) contains the latest code to date for this project.

## Outline design of project

Data Specifications are created for
* Customer Details &#10004;
* Account holder &#10004;
* Bank account
* Multiple Bank accounts
* Credit Card
* Mortgage

Functions and specifications are created for
* register-account-holder &#10004;
* open-credit-account
* open-savings-account
* open-credit-card-account
* open-mortgage-account
* Make a payment
* Send account notification
* Check for overdraft


## Development Workflow
* Write a failing test &#10004;
* write mock data &#10004;
* write an function definition that returns the argument &#10004;
* run tests - tests should fail &#10004;
* write a spec for the functions argument - customer &#10004;
* write a spec for the return value &#10004;
* write a spec for relationship between args and return value
* replace the mock data with generated values from specification &#10004;
* update functions and make tests pass &#10004;
* instrument functions
* run specification checks
