# Who uses Clojure

[Over 175 companies](http://clojure.org/community/companies) have actively advertised their Clojure adoption, and given the broad participation in user groups there are clearly many more organizations using Clojure at some level in their technology stack. 

A quick scan of various job sites shows Clojure positions at companies like Walmart, Facebook, Staples, Consumer Reports, Salesforce, and Amazon. It doesn't get much more mainstream than that. 

Here is just a small and diverse set of example companies that use Clojure for development.
