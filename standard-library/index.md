> #####Hint::Counting the functions in `clojure.core`
> You can see all the functions in `clojure.core` for yourself, simply create a default Clojure project using:
>
```bash
lein new standard-library
```
> Now I dont remember the function to get the functions in the current project... time to google when back online
