# Editors for Clojure development
The best editor to use for learning Clojure is the editor you are already familiar with (or want to learn).  Ideally this will be an editor that supports clojure by providing:

* syntax highlighting (colored parens can be useful too)
* structural editing to ensure parens are balanced when writing and refactor code
* running / connecting to a REPL process
* evaluation results inline or in a repl window (fast feedback on what the code does)
* data inspector / browser to visualise large and nested data ([external tools available](/clojure-tools/data-browsers/))

![Clojure REPL driven development with Clojure aware editors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jr0cket/developer-guides/master/clojure/clojure-repl-driven-development-clojure-aware-editor.png)

Emacs (Spacemacs), VSCode, Atom, Vim and IntelliJ are the most common Editors for Clojure and ClojureScript development. **[Install guides](editor-install-guides)** are provided for these editors.

> #### Hint::Just starting to code?
> VSCode and Calva is a good choice for those just starting to write code.


<!-- Clojure Editors -->
{% tabs vscode="VSCode & Calva", spacemacs="Emacs & Spacemacs", vimconjure="NeoVim & Conjure", spacevim="SppaceVim & Fireplace", vimiced="vim-iced", atom="Atom & Chlorine", intellij="IntelliJ & Cursive" %}


<!-- VSCode and Calva -->
{% content "vscode" %}
Use VSCode and Calva if you are familiar with VSCode or have no editor preference.

Calva is inspired by CIDER, the most popular Clojure environment for Emacs.  Calva is a very active project and the [#calva channel on the Clojurians Slack community](clojurians.slack.com/messages/calva) is very supportive.

<!-- Spacemacs -->
{% content "spacemacs" %}
[Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org/) is a community configuration bringing [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) together.  Spacemacs uses a mnemonic menu system that makes it easy to learn.

[Spacemacs, Practicalli](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs) guides you through Clojure development, documenting with org-mode, Git version control with Magit, Vim editing modes and dozens of other features.

> #### Warning::Calva with LSP adds 2Gb+ RAM
> The current version of Calva runs clojure-lsp when ever a Clojure project is opened.  The `clojure-lsp` process will use a minimum of 2Gb RAM and over 3Gb if a significant number of dependencies are included in the project.
>
> Use Calva version 2.0.134 if RAM resources are constrained.  A specific version can be selected via *Extensions > Install Another Version...*


<!-- NeoVim and Conjure -->
{% content "vimconjure"%}

[![Neovim and Conjure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/banners/neovim-conjure-banner.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/banners/neovim-conjure-banner.png)

Neovim is a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor that is a drop-in replacement of Vim, implemented in less coded, fully compatible with Vim's editing model and Vimscript extension language.  Neovim also allows configuration in Lua.

[Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) is an interactive environment for evaluating code within your running program, initially targeted at Lisp languages such as Clojure.

#### Install and user guides
* [Practicalli install guide for neovim and conjure](./editor-install-guides/neovim-conjure.md)
* [Practicalli user guide for neovim and conjure](./editor-user-guides/neovim-conjure.md)


#### Quick try tutorial
Try the Conjure interactive `:ConjureSchool` tutorial without the need to install, only a recent version of neovim
```shell
curl -fL conjure.fun/school | sh
```

<!-- Atom.io -->
{% content "atom" %}

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is flexible and simple to use editor.  [Chlorine](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine) is the recommended plugin for Atom.io. [ProtoREPL](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl) is not actively maintained at present. The [Chlorine plugin for Atom](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine) is especially recommended for ClojureScript shadow-cljs projects.

#### Chlorine
* [Chlorine install guide](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine)

![Atom.io and ProtoREPL](/images/atom-protorepl-demo.gif)


#### Proton - alternative menu and configuration approach
Proton offers a simple mnemonic menu as an alternative to the multiple keys for shortcuts in Atom.io.  Proton also gives you a simple text configuration to manage all your packages quickly.  Unfortunately Proton is not complete replacement of all actions.

<!-- IntelliJ and Cursive -->
{% content "intellij" %}
Developers from a Java background are usually familiar with IDE's such as IntelliJ, so [Cursive IDE for IntelliJ](https://cursive-ide.com/) may be an appropriate choice.  Cursive uses the static analysis of Clojure code as well as a REPL.

> #### Hint::Requires license for commercial development
> There is a free license when development is not for commercial projects, however, a license must be purchased for each developer working on a commercial project.
