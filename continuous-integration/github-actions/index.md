![GitHub Actions banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/banners/github-actions-banner.png)

Automate tasks, such as running unit tests or lint code, whenever code is committed to a  GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions can run one or more tasks after specific events, such as commits, raising issues or pull requests.

An event triggers a configured workflow which contains one or more jobs. A job contains a one or more steps which defines actions to run.

## Example GitHub Action

`.github/workflows/workflow-name.yaml` is a file that contains the workflow definition.

[Setup Java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) adds an OpenJDK distribution, i.e. Eclipse Temurin, at a specified version (Java 17 recommended).

[Setup Clojure](https://github.com/DeLaGuardo/setup-clojure) provides Clojure via Clojure CLI, Leiningen or Boot.  Clojure CLI is recommended.

[Cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) is used to cache Clojure and Java libraries (dependencies or 'deps').

The example workflow runs on Ubuntu.

The project code is checked out from the Git repository.

Java and Clojure are added to the environment

Unit tests are run using the `:test/run` alias (this alias should run Kaocha or similar test runner)

The Clojure project is packaged into an Uberjar for deployment

```yml
name: Test and Package project
on: [push]
jobs:
  clojure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Prepare java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      - name: Install clojure tools
        uses: DeLaGuardo/setup-clojure@3.7
        with:
          cli: 1.10.3.1075 # Clojure CLI based on tools.deps

      - name: Cache Clojure and Java deps
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path:
            - ~/.m2
            - ~/.gitlibs
          key: cache-${{ hashFiles('**/deps.edn') }}

      - name: Run Unit tests
        run: clojure -X:test/run

      - name: Package Clojure project
        run: clojure -X:project/uberjar
```
